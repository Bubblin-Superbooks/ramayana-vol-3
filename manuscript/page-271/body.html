<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">fail,
And ants and serpents creep and crawl
Within the consecrated hall. 
Dried are the udders of our cows,
Our elephants have juiceless brows, 
Nor can the sweetest pasture stay
The charger's long unquiet neigh.
Big tears from mules and camels flow
Whose staring coats their trouble show,
Nor can the leech's art restore
Their health and vigour as before.
Rapacious birds are fierce and bold:
Not single hunters as of old,
In banded troops they chase the prey,
Or gathering on our temples stay.
Through twilight hours with shriek and howl
Around the city jackals prowl,
And wolves and foul hy√¶nas</pre></div> </div>
