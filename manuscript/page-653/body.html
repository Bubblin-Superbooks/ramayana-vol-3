He Brahmá, Vishṇu, Śiva, he
Each person of the glorious Three,
Is every God whose praise we tell,
The King of Heaven, 
Each God revered from times of old,
The Lord of War, 
Mahendra, Time and Death is he,
The Moon, the Ruler of the Sea. 
He hears our praise in every form,—
The manes, 
The Aśvins,  they who stand
Round Indra,  band
He is the air, and life and fire,
The universal source and sire:
He brings the seasons at his call,
Creator, light, and nurse of all.
His heavenly course he joys to</pre></div> </div>
