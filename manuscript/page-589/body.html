Then Triśirás raised high his spear
Which chilled the trembling foe with fear
And, like a flashing meteor through
The air at Hanúmán it flew.
The Vánar shunned the threatened stroke,
And with strong hands the weapon broke.

Deep in the Vánar's ample chest,

Raised his broad hand, regaining might,

Which served no more its senseless lord,
And from the monster</pre></div> </div>
