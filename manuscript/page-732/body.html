Thy champion in the hopeless strife,
Who gave for thee his noble life.

Where once we lived as devotees.

Those waving boughs of densest green,
Where Rávaṇ seized his prize and stole

By lilies that adorn her side.

In plantain-sheltered hermitage.

Which sovereign Indra visited.
See where the gentle hermits</pre></div> </div>
