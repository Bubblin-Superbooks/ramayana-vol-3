From countless throats a joyful shout.
As, girt with hosts in warlike pride,
Through Lanká's streets the tyrant hied.

Went up the cry “He comes, he comes,
Our ever conquering lord who trod
Beneath his feet both fiend and God.”

Where Raghu's sons their station kept.
When Rávaṇ's car the portal passed
The sun in heaven was overcast.

And birds with boding voices cried.

A vulture flapped his horrid wing.
Big gouts of blood before him dropped,
His trembling steeds in terror</pre></div> </div>
