Then to the town his way pursued.
Around the Vánar as he went
Breathed from the wood delicious scent,
And the soft grass beneath his feet
With gem-like flowers was bright and sweet.
Still as the Vánar nearer drew
More clearly rose the town to view.
The palm her fan-like leaves displayed,
Priyálas  lent their pleasant shade,
And mid the lower greenery far
Conspicuous rose the Kovidár. 
A thousand trees mid flowers that glowed
Hung down their fruit's delicious load, 
And in their crests that rocked and swayed
Sweet birds delightful music</pre></div> </div>
