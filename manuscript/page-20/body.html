And,—for he loves his offspring,—he
Is honoured when I honour thee.
Of yore, when Krita's age  was new,
The little hills and mountains flew
Where'er they listed, borne on wings
More rapid than the feathered king's. 
But mighty terror came on all
The Gods and saints who feared their fall.
And Indra in his anger rent
Their pinions with the bolts he sent.
When in his ruthless fury he
Levelled his flashing bolt at me,
The great-souled Wind inclined to save,
And laid me neath the ocean's wave.
Thus by the favour of the sire
I kept my cherished wings entire;
And for this deed of kindness</pre></div> </div>
