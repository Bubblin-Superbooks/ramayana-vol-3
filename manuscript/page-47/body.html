On gems and gold that round him blazed,
And many a latticed window bright
With turkis and with lazulite.
Through porch and ante-rooms he passed

And spacious halls where lances lay,
And bows and shells, in fair array:
A glorious house that matched in show

Fresh buds and blossoms white and red,
And women shone, a lovely crowd,
As lightning flashes through a cloud:
A palace splendid as the sky
Which moon and planets</pre></div> </div>
