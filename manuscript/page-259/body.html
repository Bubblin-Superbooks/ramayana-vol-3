Can Raghu's son encounter foes
Fierce, numerous, and strong as those?
Yet, trained in war and practised well,
O'ermatched by thee, they fought and fell,
Stay in thy royal home, nor care
The battle and the toil to share;
But let the easy fight be won
By Indrajít  thy matchless son.
All, all shall die, if thou permit,
Slain by the hand of Indrajít.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
