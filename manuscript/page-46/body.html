<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">row,
The terror of the stricken foe.
Huge Air√°vat,  deftly trained
In battle-fields, stood ready chained.
Fair litters on the ground were set
Adorned with gems and golden net.
Gay bloomy creepers clothed the walls;
Green bowers were there and picture halls,
And chambers made for soft delight.
Broad banners waved on every height.
And from the roof like Mandar's hill
The peacock's cry came loud and shrill.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
