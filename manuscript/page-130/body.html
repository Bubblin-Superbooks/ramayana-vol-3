I see but him: my lips can frame
No syllable but Ráma's name.
Each sight I see, each sound I hear,
Brings Ráma to mine eye or ear,
The wish was in my heart, and hence
The sweet illusion mocked my sense.
'Twas but a phantom of the mind,
And yet the voice was soft and kind.
Be glory to the Eternal Sire, 
Be glory to the Lord of Fire,
The mighty Teacher in the skies, 
And Indra with his thousand eyes,
And may they grant the truth to be
E'en as the words that startled me.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
