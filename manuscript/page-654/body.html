<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">run,
Maker of Day, the golden sun.
The steeds that whirl his car are seven, 
The flaming steeds that flash through heaven.
Lord of the sky, the conqueror parts
The clouds of night with glistering darts.
He, master of the Vedas' lore,
Commands the clouds' collected store:
He is the rivers' surest friend;
He bids the rains, and they descend.
Stars, planets, constellations own
Their monarch of the golden throne.
Lord of twelve forms,  to thee I bow,
Most glorious King of heaven art thou.
O RÃ¡ma, he who pays aright
Due worship to the Lord of Light
Shall never fall oppressed by ill,
But find a stay and comfort</pre></div> </div>
