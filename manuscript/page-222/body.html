The treasured jewel to his breast,
And from his eyes the waters broke
As to the Vánar king he spoke:
“As o'er her babe the mother weeps,
This flood of tears the jewel steeps.
This gem that shone on Sítá's head
Was Janak's gift when we were wed,
And the pure brow that wore it lent
New splendour to the ornament.

The King of Heaven to Janak gave,
Whose noble sacrificial rite
Had filled the God with new delight.

Methinks I see my father's</pre></div> </div>
