Scorn not the words we say to thee.”
One awful demon, fiery-eyed,
Stood by the Maithil queen and cried:
'Come and be his, if thou art wise,
Who smote the sovereign of the skies,

From wives whom grace and youth adorn.
Thou art his chosen consort, thou

“The king whose blows, in fury dealt,
The Nágas  felt,
In battle's fiercest brunt</pre></div> </div>
