Was dark and terrible with blood.
Six giants  singled RÃ¡ma out,
And charged him with a furious shout
Loud as the roaring of the sea
When every wind is raging free.
Six times he shot: six heads were cleft;
Six giants dead on earth were left.

And from the sounding weapon rained
A storm of shafts whose fiery glare
Filled all the region of the air;

As shines in autumn nights a dell
Which fireflies, flashing through the gloom,
With momentary light</pre></div> </div>
