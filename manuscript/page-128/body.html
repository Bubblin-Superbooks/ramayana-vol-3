The Vánar legions searched for thee,
Sampáti's counsel bade me leap
A hundred leagues across the deep.

At last the long-sought Maithil queen.

Of her whom Ráma bade me trace.”

To shield her from a stranger's view;
Then, trembling in her wild surprise,
Raised to the tree her anxious eyes.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
