Oppressed by woe but undeterred.
Fear of the fiend she cast aside,
And thus in noble scorn replied:
“His word of honour never stained
King Daśaratha nobly reigned,
The bridge of right, the friend of truth.

Is Ráma, virtue's faithful friend,
Whose glories through the worlds extend.

Will smite thee with the vengeful</pre></div> </div>
