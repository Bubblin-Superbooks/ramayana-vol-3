As when the sun of autumn shrouds
His glory in a pile of clouds.
Through seven wide courts he quickly passed,
And reached the royal tower at last,
Where seats were set with couch and bed
Of gold and silver richly spread.

The sound of music reached his ear,
As the soft breathings of the flute
Came blending with the voice and lute.

And varied charm of form and face:

Gay garlands round their necks were hung,
And greater charms to each were lent
By richest dress and ornament.
