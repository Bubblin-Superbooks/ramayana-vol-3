Through Mekhal  land:
Go where Daśárṇa's  cities stand.
Avantí  seek, of high renown,
And Abravanti's  glorious town.
Search every hill and brook and cave
Where Daṇḍak's woods their branches wave
Ayomukh's  woody hill explore
Whose sides are bright with richest ore,
Lifting his glorious head on high
From bloomy groves that round him lie.
Search well his forests where the breeze
Blows fragrant from the sandal trees.
Then will you see Káverí's  stream
Whose pleasant waters glance and gleam,
And to the lovely banks entice
The sportive maids of Paradise.
