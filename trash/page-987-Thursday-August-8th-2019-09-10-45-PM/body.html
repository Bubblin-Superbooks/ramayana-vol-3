For service in the southern land.
He summoned Níla son of Fire,
And, offspring of the eternal Sire,
Jámbaván bold and strong and tall,
And Hanumán, the best of all,
And many a valiant lord beside, 
With Angad for their chief and guide.
“Go forth,” he cried, “with all this host
Exploring to the southern coast:
The thousand peaks that Vindhya shows
Where every tree and creeper grows:
Where Narmadá's  sweet waters run,
And serpents bask them in the sun:
Where Krishṇaveṇí's  currents flee,
And sparkles fair Godávarí.</pre></div> </div>
