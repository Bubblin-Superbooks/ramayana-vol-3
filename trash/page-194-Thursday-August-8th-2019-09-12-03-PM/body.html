And close beside their leader came
Twelve giant peers of might and fame.
Four other chiefs  before the rest
Behind their leader Dúshaṇ pressed.
Impetuous, cruel, dark, and dread,
All thirsting for the fray,
The hosts of giant warriors sped
Onward upon their way.
With eager speed they reached the spot
Where dwelt the princely two,—
Like planets in a league to blot
The sun and moon from view.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
