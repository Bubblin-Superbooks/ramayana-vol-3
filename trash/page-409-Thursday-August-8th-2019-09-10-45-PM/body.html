Misfortunes all his life attend,
And his brief days are near their end.
Unworthy prince, infirm of mind!
A woman spoke and he resigned
His home and kingdom and withdrew
From troops of friends and retinue.
And sought this forest dark and dread
By savage beasts inhabited.”

For love, whose words were soft and sweet.

As love's hot fire inflamed his breast.

His arm around the lady threw:
Thus Budha  with ill-omened might
Steals Rohiṇí's delicious light.
One hand her glorious tresses</pre></div> </div>
