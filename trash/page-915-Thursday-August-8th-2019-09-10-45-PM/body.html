Where street and open square were lined
With legions of the V치nar kind.
Then, as his lips with fury swelled,
The lord of Raghu's line beheld
A stream of V치nar chiefs outpoured
To do obeisance to their lord.
But when the mighty prince in view
Of the thick coming V치nars drew,
They turned them in amaze to seize
Crags of the rock and giant trees.
He saw, and fiercer waxed his ire,
As oil lends fury to the fire.
Scarce had the V치nar chieftains seen
That wrathful eye, that troubled mien
Fierce as the God's who rules the dead,
When, turned in wild affright, they fled.
Speeding in breathless terror</pre></div> </div>
