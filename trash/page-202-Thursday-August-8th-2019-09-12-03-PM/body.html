And all the life that moved within
The woodland trembled at the din.
In eager haste all fled to find
Some tranquil spot, nor looked behind.
With every arm of war supplied,
On-rushing wildly like the tide
Of some deep sea, the giant host
Approached where RÃ¡ma kept his post.

Bent his keen eye on every side,
And viewed the host of Khara face
To face before his dwelling-place.

And strained that bow which foemen feared,
And yielded to the vengeful sway
Of fierce desire that host to slay.
Terrific as the ruinous</pre></div> </div>
