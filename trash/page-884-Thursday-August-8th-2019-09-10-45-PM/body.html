In all her robes and gems arrayed,
While from the sedgy banks are heard
The soft notes of each amorous bird.
O see what lovely islets stud
Like gems the bosom of the flood,
And s√°rases and wild swans crowd
About her till she laughs aloud.

Some tender blue, some dazzling red,
And opening lilies white as snow
Their buds in rich profusion show.

There stands the curlew by the stream,
And holy hermits love to throng
Where the sweet waters speed along.
Ranged on the grassy margin shine
Gay sandal trees in glittering</pre></div> </div>
