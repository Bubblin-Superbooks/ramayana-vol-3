<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">gold,
For King Kuvera  wrought of old,
A home the heavenly artist planned
And fashioned with his cunning hand.
There lotuses adorn the flood
With full-blown flower and opening bud
Where swans and mallards float, and gay
Apsarases  come down to play.
There King Vaiśravaṇ's  self, the lord
By all the universe adored,
Who golden gifts to mortals sends,
Lives with the Guhyakas  his friends.
Search every cavern in the steep,
And green glens where the moonbeams sleep,
If haply in that distant ground
The robber and the dame be found.
Then on to Krauncha's hill,  and through
His fearful pass your way</pre></div> </div>
