A cloud upon the warrior's face
Stealing the cheerful light away,
His life is doomed in battle fray.

With shout and roar the fiends draw nigh.
With thundering beat of many a drum

To meet, prepared, the coming blow:
In paths of prudence trained aright
They watch the stroke before it smite.

And with the Maithil lady go
For shelter to the mountain cave
Where thickest trees their branches wave.
