<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I
Guard ever for that heavenly dame
This home, Svayamprabhá  my name,—
For I have loved the lady long,
So skilled in arts of dance and song.
But say what cause your steps has led
The mazes of this grove to tread.
How, strangers did ye chance to spy
The wood concealed from wanderer's eye?
Tell clearly why ye come: but first
Eat of this fruit and quench your thirst.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
