The glories of their blooms expand,
And the resplendent earth is strown
With peerless pearl and precious stone.
There stately trees can scarce uphold
The burthen of their fruits of gold,
And ever flaunt their gay attire
Of flower and leaf like flames of fire.
All there sweet lives untroubled spend
In bliss and joy that know not end,
While pearl-decked maidens laugh, or sing
To music of the silvery string. 
Still on your forward journey keep,
And rest you by the northern deep,
Where springing from the billows high
Mount Somagiri  seeks the sky,
And lightens with perpetual glow
The sunless realm that lies</pre></div> </div>
