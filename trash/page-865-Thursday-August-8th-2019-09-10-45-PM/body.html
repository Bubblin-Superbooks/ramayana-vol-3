Where pleasure mounds in carven wood
And many a graven figure stood.
The best of jewels o'er it hung,
And wreaths of flowers around it clung,
And over all was raised on high
A canopy of saffron dye,
While like the sun of morning shone
The brilliant blooms that lay thereon.

And with all funeral service graced.”

Whereon, with weeping Angad's aid,
The relics of the chief were laid
Neath many a vesture's varied</pre></div> </div>
