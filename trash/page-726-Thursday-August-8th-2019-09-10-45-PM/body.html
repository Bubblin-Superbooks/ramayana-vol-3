And sped within the dark retreat.
While in the cave he stayed, and I
Watched at the mouth, a year went by.

And greater horror seized my breast
When from the cavern rolled a flood,
A carnage stream of froth and blood;
And from the depths a sound of fear,
The roar of demons, smote mine ear;
But never rang my brother's shout
Triumphant in the battle rout.

Huge as a hill, of shattered rock.
