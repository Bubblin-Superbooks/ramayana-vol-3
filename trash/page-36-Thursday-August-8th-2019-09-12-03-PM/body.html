For giants when their days are told:
Their bodies laid in earth, they rise
To homes eternal in the skies.”

And Ráma to his brother cried:

His elephantine bulk to fit.
And let the hollowed earth enfold
This mighty giant fierce and bold.”

Upon the giant's neck his foot.
His spade obedient Lakshmaṇ</pre></div> </div>
