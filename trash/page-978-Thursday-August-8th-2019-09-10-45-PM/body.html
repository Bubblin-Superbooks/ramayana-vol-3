Sarasvati  tide,
And rapid Śona's  pebbly side.
Then roam afar by Mahí's  bed
Where Kálamahí's groves are spread.
Go where the silken tissue shines,
Go to the land of silver mines. 
Visit each isle and mountain steep
And city circled by the deep,
And distant villages that high
About the peaks of Mandar lie.
Speed over Yavadwipa's land, 
And see Mount Śiśir  proudly stand
Uplifting to the skies his head
By Gods and Dánavs visited.

Each tangled thicket deep in grass.
Search every cave with utmost</pre></div> </div>
