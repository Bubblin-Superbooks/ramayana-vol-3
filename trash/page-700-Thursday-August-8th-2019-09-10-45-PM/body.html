To Sítá fiends, and Vánar king 
Apportioned bliss and bale.
Through her left eye quick throbbings shot, 
Glad signs the lady doubted not,
That told their hopeful tale.
The bright left eye of Báli felt
An inauspicious throb that dealt
A deadly blow that day.
The fiery left eyes of the crew
Of demons felt the throb, and knew
The herald of dismay.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
