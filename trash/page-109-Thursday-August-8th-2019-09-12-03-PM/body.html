He viewed the seat of many a God,
Brahmá and Agni,  Sun and Moon,
And His who sends each golden boon; 
Here Vishṇu's stood, there Bhaga's  shrine,
And there Mahendra's, Lord divine;
Here His who formed this earthly frame, 
His there from whom all beings came. 
Váyu's,  and His who loves to hold
The great noose, Varuṇ  mighty-souled:
Here was the Vasus'  shrine to see,
Here that of sacred Gáyatrí, 
The king of serpents  here had place,
And he who rules the feathered race. 
Here Kártikeya,  warrior lord,
And there was Justice King adored.
Then with disciples girt about
The mighty saint himself came</pre></div> </div>
