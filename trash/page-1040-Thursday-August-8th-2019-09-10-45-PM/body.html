Were through the mazy cavern led.
Again the gracious lady spoke,
And joy in every bosom woke:

Whose valleys trees and creepers fill;
And, by the margin of the sea,
Praśravaṇ where you fain would be.”
With blessings then she bade adieu,
And swift within the cave withdrew.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
