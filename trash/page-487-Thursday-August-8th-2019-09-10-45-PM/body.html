Alas, if Lakshmaṇ chanced to hear
That bitter cry of woe and fear
What time Márícha, as he died,
With voice that mocked my accents cried,

He led me far through brake and dell
Till wounded by my shaft he fell,
And as he sank rang out his cry,

In the great wood with none to aid,
For every fiend is now my</pre></div> </div>
