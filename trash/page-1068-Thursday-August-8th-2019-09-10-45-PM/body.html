Condemned, because we wrought a deed
Of shame, on flesh and blood to feed.
But all Suparṇa's  wondrous powers
And length of keenest sight are ours,
That we a hundred leagues away
Through fields of air descry our prey.
Now from this spot my gazing eye
Can Rávaṇ and the dame descry.
Devise some plan to overleap
This barrier of the briny deep.
Find the Videhan lady there,
And joyous to your home repair.
Me too, O Vánars, to the side
Of Varuṇ's  home the ocean, guide,
Where due libations shall be paid
To my great-hearted brother's shade.”</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
