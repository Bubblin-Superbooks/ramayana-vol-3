In garments pure of spot or speck,
A heavenly wreath about his neck.
Resplendent in his bright attire
He sprang exultant from the pyre.
While from neck, arm, and foot was sent
The flash of gold and ornament.
High on a chariot, bright of hue,
Which swans of fairest pinion drew,

With splendid glow reflected there.

And called to Ráma from afar:

The means to win thy spouse again.
Six plans, O prince, the wise pursue
To reach the aims we hold in view. 
When evils ripening sorely</pre></div> </div>
