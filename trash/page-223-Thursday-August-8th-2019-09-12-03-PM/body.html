<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">day,
Khara, great chief, survived the fray,
The monster of the triple head, 
And Raghu's son, the foeman's dread.
The other demon warriors, all
Skilful and brave and strong and tall,
In front of battle, side by side,
Struck down by Lakshmaṇ's brother died.
When Khara saw the host he led
Triumphant forth to fight
Stretched on the earth, all smitten dead,
By Ráma's nobler might,
Upon his foe he fiercely glared,
And drove against him fast,
Like Indra when his arm is bared
His thundering bolt to cast.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
